Cloudrail has listed "pseudo" objects in the above results.
These are resources that don't exist yet, or don't show in the Terraform input, but we know will be created in the real live environment.

Cloudrail ran this assessment without any policies and so all rule violations show as warnings.
You can increase a rule's enforcement level by creating a Policy in the Web UI and adding the rule to it.
