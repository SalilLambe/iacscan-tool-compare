Bad actor may often be willing to go through multiple steps to reach
their destination. If a public resource can become a step stone, or a
jump point, to a private resource, they will try to abuse it. Therefore,
it's best not to have private resources accessible directly from public
resources without any security mechanism between them.

This test case simulates a case where this best practice is _not_ followed.
