S3 Bucket Public ACL Overridden By Public Access Block, Severity: LOW, Results: 1
CIS ID: CIS Security - CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark v1.4.0 - Rule 2.1.5
Title: Ensure that S3 Buckets are configured with 'Block public access (bucket settings)'
Description: Amazon S3 provides Block public access (bucket settings) and Block public access (account settings) to help you manage public access to Amazon S3 resources. By default, S3 buckets and objects are created with public access disabled. However, an IAM principal with sufficient S3 permissions can enable public access at the bucket and/or object level. While enabled, Block public access (bucket settings) prevents an individual bucket, and its contained objects, from becoming publicly accessible. Similarly, Block public access (account settings) prevents all buckets, and contained objects, from becoming publicly accessible across the entire account.
Amazon S3 Block public access (bucket settings) prevents the accidental or malicious public exposure of data contained within the respective bucket(s). Amazon S3 Block public access (account settings) prevents the accidental or malicious public exposure of data contained within all buckets of the respective AWS account. Whether blocking public access to all or some buckets is an organizational decision that should be based on data sensitivity, least privilege, and use case.

S3 Bucket Without Enabled MFA Delete, Severity: HIGH, Results: 1
CIS ID: CIS Security - CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark v1.4.0 - Rule 2.1.3
Title: Ensure MFA Delete is enable on S3 buckets
Description: Once MFA Delete is enabled on your sensitive and classified S3 bucket it requires the user to have two forms of authentication.
Adding MFA delete to an S3 bucket, requires additional authentication when you change the version state of your bucket or you delete and object version adding another layer of security in the event your security credentials are compromised or unauthorized access is granted.
